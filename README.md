[Verse 1: Jim Colerick]
Well I wrote this song for the Christian youth
I wanna teach kids the Christian truth
If you wanna reach those kids on the street
Then you gotta do a rap to a hip-hop beat
So I gave my sermon an urban kick
My rhymes are fly, my beats are sick
My crew is big and it keeps getting bigger
That's cause Jesus Christ is my nigga

[Hook: Jim Colerick]
Oooooooo

[Verse 2: Jim Colerick]
He's a life-changer, miracle-arranger
Born to the virgin mom in a manger
Water to wine, he's a drink exchanger
And he died for your sins
I preach the word, that's my gig
And I rhyme better than Notorious BIG
All the other emcees, I wish them well
But if you live in sin, you burn in hell
Now I'ma pass the mic to my lovely wife
She's a fly emcee and the light of my life
So to bust a rhyme without further ado
Take it away, Mary Sue!

[Verse 3: Mary Sue]
Jesus Christ is my nigga
He's the son of the original G
And he was sent to Earth to elucidate the way that we should be
(What?)
Like if another MC says
"You're a freak!
You're a lame-butt rapper
And your rhymes are weak!"
I don't get mad and I don't critique
I forgive him, and turn the other cheek
I don't blaspheme and I don't brag
I don't cuss, and my pants don't sag
I do exude a little Christian swag
And I'm proud to be an American!

[Hook: Both]
Jesus Christ is our nigga
Let his light shine through ya!
Let his love pop a cap in your butt and say HALLELUJAH!

[Verse 4: Both]
Jesus Christ is our nigga
He's a homie MC JC UC?
He's an honest, caring, peace-loving nigga
Like me
If you do drugs and you think you're cool
You need to come to Sunday school!
Put those drugs in a garbage can
Stand up tall, you're a Christian man!

[Outro: Jim Colerick and Mary Sue]
Word up!
I'm freestyling!
Hit me!
